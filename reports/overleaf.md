# Creating a Report in Overleaf

## Step 1: Sign Up for Overleaf
Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and sign up for a free account using your email.

## Step 2: Start a New Project
Click "New Project" > "Blank Project".

## Step 3: Upload Your `.tex` File
Click "Upload Project", then drag & drop your `.tex` file or click "Choose Files" for your file system. The file is already named `main.tex`, so it will work automatically.

## Step 4: Import Images Manually
Place all images from the [output](./outputs) folder in the overleaf directory, using the `upload` button at the top left of the page.

Done, the report should render with all images correctly, and you can edit anything you want
