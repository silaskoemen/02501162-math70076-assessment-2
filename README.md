# 02501162-math70076-assessment-2

This repository contains the assessment 2 project for the course Math70076. The project focuses on analyzing the forest fires dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict the area of forest fires in the Montesinho National Park. The goal is to explore various machine learning models and data science tools to understand the impact of different variables on the outcome.

## General Info

This project utilizes the forest fires dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires). The aim is to apply different machine learning models and data science techniques to predict the area of forest fires and identify the key variables influencing the outcome.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various features related to weather conditions, fire behavior, and geographical location, among others.

## Analyses

This section contains the analyses performed on the dataset, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training and evaluation.

## Outputs

The outputs folder contains the results of the analyses, including visualizations, model predictions, and performance metrics.
