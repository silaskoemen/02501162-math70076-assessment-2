# General Info:
This project uses the openly available forest fires dataset from the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires) and aims to demonstrate how to use different machine learning models and data science tools to best predict the area of forest fires in the Montesinho National Park. Additionally, this project investigates the different variables and how they affect the outcome/which variables are the most important drivers.
